# ABD-vs-Bumrah-Analysis-
In this analysis we see who got the better of who, Jasprit Bumrah or AB de Villiers and how to they compare to other players.
We first calculate the basic stats which are:
 1. Strike Rate or SR - Runs Scored / Balls Faced
 2. Total Number of dismissals - How many times did a bowler get a batsman out.
 3. Average - Runs Scored / Total No. of Dismissals

This gives us a statistical analysis but for a fair analysis we see how they perform against others batsmen/bowler.
For this we plot a scatter graph of Runs Scored vs SR and divide them in 4 quardrants and analyse.
